# Catbox

Catbox is a game engine made by 2 students over the course of 1 year for The Game Assembly school.
The editor and core GameObject/Component system and workflow is heavily based on Unity.
The engine is made in C++ and uses DirectX11.
Disclaimer: It's not perfect, but it's usable and we actually managed to make a really good game in it (https://elingranath.itch.io/shells-kitchen)! 
If anyone is interested in improving it (mainly struggling with performance in large open worlds), that would be cool! c:
